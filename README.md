- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Amber (Po) Hou. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a machine learning engineer with a knack for turning raw data into actionable insights and scalable AI solutions. My background spans finance, eCommerce, and AI-driven innovation, with hands-on experience in recommendation systems, NLP, and predictive analytics.
- ðŸš€ During my time at ByteDance, I built and deployed sentiment analysis models and recommendation algorithms for TikTok Ads, optimizing user engagement and conversion ratesâ€”because who doesnâ€™t love efficiency? ðŸ˜Ž
- ðŸš´ Beyond work, Iâ€™m passionate about AI for social good, leading Fordhamâ€™s very first Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) club to bridge the gap between learning and real-world impact. I've just started my Project 2025 as a writer/content creator on LinkedIn on topics such as AI for social good, AI and community building, leveraging AI for product design, and more. Iâ€™m all about learning and building in publicâ€”and having a little fun along the way!

- ðŸŒ± PS: I am a recent graduate looking for DA/DS/MLE roles with a mission-driven focus. Hire me. Let me help you solve business problems :"D
